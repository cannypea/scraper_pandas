This code performs the following tasks:

1. Imports the pandas library with the alias `pd` and the `ssl` module.
2. Sets up an SSL context to allow accessing HTTPS websites without verification.
3. Uses `pd.read_html()` function to scrape tables from the Wikipedia page "List of presidents of the United States". This function attempts to extract all the tables from the given URL and returns them as a list of DataFrame objects.
4. Iterates over each DataFrame in the list obtained from `pd.read_html()`, printing each table along with its index in the list.
5. Finally, it seems like there's a typo (`scraper[0]` is outside the loop and there's a space before it), so it won't be executed in the current context. If intended, it could be used to access the first DataFrame directly after the loop.
